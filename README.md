# SHItool_Mexico
This is an interdisciplinary modelling tool created to assess the impacts of decentralised sanitation on the socio-hydrological resilience of Mexico City, using the constructed wetlands (CWs). This scalable tool highlights areas that have the lowest resilience and enables the assessment of different schemes for optimising resilience. The datasets used in this study are not available and we provided a synthetic made-up dataset for the users. The scale of this study is 'manzanas' level for Mexico City and its metropolitan area of influence. Details of the variables used, definitions of indexes and subindexes and its equations for the tool applied to Mexico Cityâ€™s Metropolitan Area (MCDMX) can be found in www.mexicoshr.com. Finally, in this study and using this tool we produced the social-hydrological resilience index across MCDMX both now and in the future, based on forecast climate, land-use and population change in 2050.
