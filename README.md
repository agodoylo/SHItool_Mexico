# SHItool_Mexico
This is an interdisciplinary modelling tool to assess the impacts of decentralised sanitation on the socio-hydrological resilience of Mexico City, using the constructed wetlands (CWs). This scalable tool highlights areas that have the lowest resilience and enables the assessment of different schemes for optimising resilience. The datasets used in this study reflect those currently available. At the scale of this study ('manzanas' level), datasets were often incomplete and we fill these gaps averaging the properties of surrounding neighbourhoods at the upper 'colonias' level in the /Fillmissing folder. Finally this tool produces the social-hydrological resilience index across Mexico City both now and in the future, based on forecast climate, land-use and population change in 2050.
